# Currency TDD Demo

For a demonstration of test-driven development (TDD) in regards to money 
amounts.

Java 8 and JUnit 5. I'm using Eclipse, not because I particularly like it, but 
because I think it's much easier for someone wanting to import this 
demonstration into a different integrated development environment (IDE) to 
import from Eclipse to IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans than the other way around.

It is highly recommended that you have an API key for a currency conversion 
service. Place an operating system environment variable called "FOREX_API_KEY" 
that contains your secret API key.

WARNING: Do not write your API key in any file in this project, not even in 
files excluded by the Git Ignore.

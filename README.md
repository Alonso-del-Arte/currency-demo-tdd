# Currency TDD Demo

For a demonstration of test-driven development (TDD) in regards to money 
amounts.

It is highly recommended that you have an API key for a currency conversion 
service. Place an operating system environment variable called "FOREX_API_KEY" 
that contains your secret API key.

WARNING: Do not write your API key in any file in this project, not even in 
files excluded by the Git Ignore.
